Python Built in Functions:

print()         //show smth
Operators:

%s()            //it is like marker, that marks values (temporary substitute), which you want to add, just add it into your variable (page 33)
                     example:      >>> wallet = 46
                                   >>> message = 'hi, you have %s coins'
                                   >>> print(message % wallet)
                                      hi, you have 46 coins 

Python List/Array Methods:

.append()       //method, that appends an element to the end of the list

Python Keywords:

del               //to define a function


                //for operations with variables you (do it without quotes)
'               //for operations with text (lines)
"               //for operations with text (lines)
'''             //for operations with text (double and more lines and lines, that contain qutos and apostrophe)
\               //you can use this symbol before qutos and apostrophe in your line, it names screening and then you needn't use triple                     single quotes, like this ''' (page 32)
[ ]             //for creating lists, you can edit, print and cut one of the object in the list using the same brackets
[ : ]           //by this you can show some of the objects
                  example:  >>> list_a=['car' , 'house', 'road' , 'bird']
                            >>> print( list_a [1:3] )                         //note, that if you from 1 (including) to 3 (exclusively)
                                    ['house', 'road']                         //note, that list begins with 0 

Errors:

SyntaxError  //there is a problem with symbols
EOL             //end-of-line
